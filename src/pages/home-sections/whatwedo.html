    <hr class="hr-black">
    <p>The induction motor industry was the first industry we started servicing in the late 80s. Our product range has therefore developed around this industry. We make almost all thermal classes of cables required in motors. We also harness them to provide lead wire sets. </p>
    <p>We manufacture woven tapes and sleeves in-house. We also make insulation kits complete with; slot liners, shapers or phase barriers, closures, wedges, films, lead wire sets and sleeves cut-to-size.</p>
